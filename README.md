Building a Logistic Regression model.

Task
You are given a feature matrix and a single datapoint to predict. Your job will be to build a Logistic Regression model with the feature matrix and make a prediction (1 or 0) of the single datapoint.

Input Format
First line: Number of data points in the feature matrix (n)

Next n lines: Values of the row in the feature matrix, separated by spaces
Next line: Target values separated by spaces
Final line: Values (separated by spaces) of a single datapoint without a target value

Output Format
Either 1 or 0

Calculating Evaluation Metrics using the Confusion Matrix.

Task
You will be given the values of the confusion matrix (true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives). Your job is to compute the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score and print the values rounded to 4 decimal places. To round, you can use round(x, 4).

Input Format
The values of tp, fp, fn, tn, in that order separated by spaces

Output Format
Each value on its own line, rounded to 4 decimal places, in this order:
accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score
